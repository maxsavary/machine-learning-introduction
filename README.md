# Machine Learning From Scratch

*Author : maxime.savary@orange.com (v1.0 December 2020)*


This article is an introduction to **Machine Learning**. For need and interest in a new domain described as a *Revolution*, it seems interesting to see what's going on. But how to start with a topic wrapped at once by a set of fields and ideas (Science, politics, philosophy, ethics, etc ...). In a first step, the more rational is to enter in the technical field in order to have the description of the thing. 

The objective is to introduce a background allowing to understand "how it works" beyond the use and the knowledge of the fields of application of the different algorithms necessary to the "Data Scientist". To break down and even partially pose the calculations, allows to better apprehend what we can do in a "strong" field regarding its results but relatively simple on the real concepts implemented. We can pass the details of calculations when they are clarified and simply stop on the final formulation. So don't be afraid with formulas, it takes time to capture the details, but I hope these notes will technically enlighten the subject.

This introduction is divided in three sections : 
* Supervised Learning
    * [Regression](https://max7336.github.io/ml-introduction-suplearn-reg.html)
    * [Classification (SVM)](https://max7336.github.io/ml-introduction-suplearn-class.html)
* Unsupervised Learning
    * [KMeans](https://max7336.github.io/ml-introduction-unsuplearn.html)
* Neural Network
    * [Some Concept and Theory](https://max7336.github.io/ml-introduction-nn-sometheory.html)
    * [Pytorch Examples](https://max7336.github.io/ml-introduction-nn-pytorch.html)


Mathematical concepts attached to ML practiced in Information Technology are centered on Optimization. Roughly it consists on minimizing an error function ***H*** representing the Model of the problem

We introduce 3 Mathematical keys notion attached to ML :
* The Cost Function
* The Gradient Descent
* Backpropagation (Neurals Network)
